# Read It or Watch It? App

# Description

Finding it difficult to think of your next read or movie? Have a book or movie in mind, but don't know if you should read it or maybe watch it? We have created a web application where the user can obtain detailed information for books and movies (such as the synopsis, director/author, parental rating, and book cover and movie poster images) just by entering a search term. On the web application, the user can also be directed to Google Books to purchase the book title related to their inquiry - or watch a trailer through IMDb.

# User Story

AS A reader and movie watcher   
I WANT to look up book and movie recommendations and compare the two mediums  
SO THAT I can find information about authors/directors, decide if I am more interested in watching the movie or reading the book, and be directed to links to purchase the book or watch the trailer of the movie that interests me.
