## Description

Finding it difficult to think of your next read or movie? Have a book or movie in mind, but don't know if you should read it or maybe watch it? We have created a web application where the user can obtain detailed information for books and movies (such as the synopsis, director/author, parental rating, book cover and movie poster images) just by entering a search term. On the web application, the user can also be directed to Google Books to purchase the book title related to their inquiry or watch a trailer through IMDb.

Read or Watch It? is a multimedia search application that utilizes the Google Books API, OMDB API, and AJAX calls to search for user-inputted titles of movies and books simultaneously. The application was built using jQuery, JavaScript, Express, Node, and the Materialize framework.
